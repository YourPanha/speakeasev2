# SpeakEase - AI-Powered Assistive Communication Tool

## Overview
SpeakEase is an innovative AI-powered assistive communication tool designed for speech-impaired, deaf, and blind individuals. It leverages computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and speech synthesis to translate sign language, gestures, and eye movements into real-time text or speech output. The solution aims to bridge communication gaps in healthcare, education, and daily life, offering an affordable and scalable alternative to traditional AAC devices and human interpreters.

## Problem Statement
- *63 million people* in India are unable to speak, and *350 interpreters* serve only *18 million* of them.
- *89% of deaf patients* report misdiagnoses due to communication barriers.
- *39 million people globally are blind*, facing challenges in identifying objects and navigating safely.
- Struggles in *education, **employment, and **daily communication* persist for these communities.

## Key Features
- *Real-Time Sign Language Translation*: Converts hand signs into text or speech using AI.
- *Multi-Language Support*: Supports Indian Sign Language (ISL), American Sign Language (ASL), and regional variations.
- *Object Detection for the Blind*: Uses a camera to detect objects and convert their names into audio (Hindi/English).
- *Intruder Alert System*: Face recognition and boundary alerts for mute/blind individuals living alone.
- *Text-to-Animated Sign Language*: Premium feature to convert text into animated signs.
- *Offline Capability*: Lightweight models ensure functionality without internet access.

## Technology Stack
- *Frontend*: Next.js  
- *Backend*: Express.js, Node.js  
- *Database*: MongoDB  
- *AI Models*: TensorFlow, OpenCV, PyTorch, Whisper AI  
- *Deployment*: FastAPI, TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime  

## Solution Architecture
1. *Input Layer*: Captures gestures, signs, and text via camera or keyboard.
2. *AI Processing Layer*:  
   - Computer vision (OpenCV, MediaPipe) for sign/gesture recognition.  
   - NLP (Whisper AI, DeepSpeech) for text-to-speech conversion.  
3. *Backend*:  
   - RESTful APIs (FastAPI) for integration.  
   - PostgreSQL for user data storage.  
4. *Output Layer*: Delivers speech synthesis and visual feedback.  

## Market Opportunity
- *TAM*: 63 million mute individuals in India.  
- *SAM*: 6 million active ISL users.  
- *SOM*: 1.2 million urban ISL users with smartphones.  
- *Industries*: Healthcare, EdTech, Customer Service, Smart Assistants.  

## Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
- *No competing app* on Play Store with similar features.  
- *Cost-effective* compared to traditional AAC devices.  
- *Device-independent* (works on any camera-enabled device).  
- *Multilingual* and *scalable* open-source AI models.  

## Business Model
- *B2B*: Partnerships with healthcare sectors.  
- *B2C*: Freemium subscription model with premium features.  
- *Advertisement*: Revenue from targeted ads.  

## Challenges
- Dataset limitations for training AI models.  
- Ensuring real-time prediction accuracy and low latency.  

## Future Scope
- Expand language support for global accessibility.  
- Integrate with wearables for gesture recognition.  
- Enhance AI with emotion detection and context awareness.
